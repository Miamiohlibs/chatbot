"""
Embedding-nearest-neighbor intent classifier.

Replaces the 4-stage router (heuristics -> Weaviate -> margin -> LLM
triage) with a single cheap call: embed the user message, cosine-
nearest-neighbor against ~50 labeled exemplar utterances, return the
top intent and a confidence margin.

Why this shape:
  - One embedding call per turn (~$0.00001 with text-embedding-3-large)
    instead of one LLM triage per turn (~$0.005). Two orders of
    magnitude cheaper.
  - Deterministic. The exemplar set is data, not code; adding a
    misclassified utterance to the exemplar set fixes future
    misclassifications without retraining.
  - Easy to debug. When a query routes wrong, the top-k nearest
    exemplars are an immediately-actionable explanation.

Confidence handling:
  - margin = top-1 score - top-2 score
  - margin >= MARGIN_HIGH        -> route directly
  - MARGIN_LOW <= margin < HIGH -> route, but flag low-margin in
                                    telemetry (don't ask the user)
  - margin < MARGIN_LOW          -> ask the user a clarification with
                                    the top-2 candidates as buttons

The two thresholds are intentional: most "did you mean" UIs are
infuriating because they fire on every borderline case. We only
bother the user when the classifier is genuinely confused.

See plan:
  - Layer 3 -> "Intent kNN classifier"
  - Layer 3 -> "Confidence gates"

Status: SCAFFOLD. The classifier itself is fully implemented (cosine
math is trivial), but it's gated on:
  1. An exemplar set per intent (lives in src/router/exemplars/).
     Empty initially; week 3 work to populate from LibChat transcripts.
  2. An embedder. Wired through as a Protocol so tests inject a fake
     and the real OpenAI embedder lands when src/llm/client.py does
     (gated by the model freshness rule).
